    PROBLEM 1: Use a for...in loop to iterate through the properties of the object 'person' and log each property name and its value to the console in this format: "name: value".
    */

    }

    for (let property in person) {
      console.log(`${property}: ${person[property]}`);

    PROBLEM 2: Use a for...in loop to iterate through the properties of the object 'car' and log only the property names to the console.
    */

    PROBLEM 3: Create a function named 'printObjectValues' that takes the 'foodItem' object below as an argument and logs each property value to the console.
    */

      for (let property in obj) {
        console.log(obj[property]);

    PROBLEM 4: Create a function named 'calculateTotalPrice' that takes the 'shoppingCart' object below as an argument and calculates the total price of all the items in the object.
    */
    const shoppingCart = {

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following code is supposed to log each property name and value of the 'book' object to the console. But it has a bug that prevents it from working correctly. Find the bug and fix the code.
    */
